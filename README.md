# Responsive-Portfolio

<!-- MEDIA QUERIES:
begin at line 214 in styles.css file -->

<!-- NAVBAR:
At the first two resizes (980px and 768px), the nested divs that comprise the navbar are restyled almost exactly the same way;  the horizontal menu ( as a list placed inside a div) is floated absolute right. In the third resize (640px) the div spanning the entire navbar is irrelevant, and the div containing my name is resized to width 100% and tethered to the top, with the div containing the horizontal list also resized to 100% and placed directly below it. -->

<!-- CONTENT AREA:
 is resized appropriately in all three different sizes, with the height of the box containing the content increased to encompass all of the content as the browser size decreases. -->

<!-- in the PORTFOLIO page, each of the GALLERY elements containing the projects are resized approrpriately to match the screenshots. -->
